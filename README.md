# Tutorial Name
Including animations in your user interface can take it to the next level and really make it pop. This tutorial teaches you how to use style transitions to animate your UI. It includes very minimal C# code to help stagger the animations, rather than having them all run at once. By the end, you will have the first screen in the Design an interactive game UI with Figma created and animated in Unity via UI Toolkit.

Part 1, [Design an interactive game UI with Figma](https://gamedev-resources.com/design-a-game-ui-with-figma/), covers the basics of using the free tier of Figma to rapidly prototype a new main menu design. You can skip the first tutorial if you do not want to learn about Figma.
